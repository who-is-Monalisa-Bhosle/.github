## The Viral Sensation
Monalisa's natural beauty and serene demeanor captured the attention of numerous visitors. Many took photos and videos of her, which went viral on social media platforms, turning her into an overnight sensation.

## Impact of Fame
While the newfound attention brought Monalisa into the spotlight, it also affected her ability to sell garlands:

- This disrupted her family's income and daily routine.

Her father, overwhelmed by the situation, decided to send Monalisa back to Indore to help her escape the overwhelming attention and resume a normal life.
